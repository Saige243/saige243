# I'm Saige.👋
At the moment:
- • 🔥 I'm building awesome things with awesome people at [Of Ash And Fire](https://www.ofashandfire.com/).
- • 🆗 I volunteer/am a part of [Techlahoma](https://www.techlahoma.org/).
- • 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm working on multiple projects of my own, including (but not limited to) a Goodreads substitute, an AI Argument App, and a budget app for coffee/tea lovers.
- • 🌱 I love working with any tech stack, but have spent most of my time recently within the MERN stack.

- • 💬 Let's talk about: Literature, movies, music, hummus.
- • 🤔 When I'm not coding I'm: reading, doing something involving music, at the movies, wishing I was cool enough to be a rock climber.
- • ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a pug dad.
