# I'm Saige.👋
## At the moment:
- 🔥 I'm building awesome things with awesome people at [Of Ash And Fire](https://www.ofashandfire.com/).
- 🆗 I volunteer/am a part of [Techlahoma](https://www.techlahoma.org/).
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm working on multiple projects of my own, including (but not limited to) a Goodreads substitute and a travel app built with Rails.
- 🌱 I love working with any tech stack, but have spent most of my time recently within MERN.
- 💬 Let's talk about: literature, movies, music, hummus.
- 🤔 When I'm not coding I'm: reading, writing, doing something involving music, at the movies, wishing I was cool enough to be a rock climber.
